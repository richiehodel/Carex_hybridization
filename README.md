These scripts are associated with the manuscript https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16502

Inspiration from these analyses came from this tutorial:
'https://popgen.nescent.org/2018-03-27_RDA_GEA.html'

In this repository, there are two scripts ('RDA_script.R' and 'Loadings_script.R')

The 'RDA_script.R' performs the redundancy analysis on different datasets with the 
input file specified by the user.

The input files are .stru files and .txt files.

The output files from the 'RDA_script.R' are files with loadings from RDAs.
These files are input files for 'Loadings_script.R'.
